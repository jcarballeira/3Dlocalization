RSearch3D query a GL-Tree for Radius search

SYNTAX
idc=RSearch3D(p,qp,ptrtree,r);

INPUT PARAMETERS

      p: [3xN] double array coordinates of reference points

      qp:  [3x1] double array  coordinates of query points.
              NOTE: differently from NNsearch this function
              does not support multiple query points.               

      ptrtree: a pointer to the previously constructed  GLtree.Warning
               if the pointer is uncorrect it will cause a crash, there is
               no way to check this in the mex routine, you have to check
               it in your script.

      r: double value, radius to perform the search. 


OUTPUT PARAMETERS

  idc: [?x1] column vector, each rows contains an index of a point found in
       the range described by the radius.
        

GENERAL INFORMATIONS

        -Conditions for a point to be found in the radius is <=, so
        points with distance from the query=r will be returned.
